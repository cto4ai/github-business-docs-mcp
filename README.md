## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)
2. **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**: This is **CRUCIAL** for the server to function.
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic) or Fine-grained tokens.
   - Generate a new token with at least these scopes:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories) - Recommended for full functionality.
     - `user:read` or `user:email` (to read user profile data).
     - `read:org` (if you need to access organization information).
   - **Important**: Store this token securely. You will need to provide it directly in your MCP client's configuration for this server (see Step 3 below).

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create the project
```bash
mkdir github-repos-manager-mcp
cd github-repos-manager-mcp
# Save the server.cjs, package.json, and README.md files into this directory.
npm install
chmod +x server.cjs # Make the server script executable
```

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Roo Code, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
Add the following configuration to your MCP client.
- Replace `/full/path/to/your/project/github-repos-manager-mcp/server.cjs` with the actual absolute path to the `server.cjs` script.
- **Crucially, replace `"ghp_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE"` with your GitHub Personal Access Token within the `env` block.** This is how the server receives the token.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/your/project/github-repos-manager-mcp/server.cjs"],
      "env": {
        "GH_TOKEN": "ghp_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test the Server
Once the MCP client is configured with the correct path to `server.cjs` and your `GH_TOKEN`, the server should start automatically when the client attempts to use one of its tools.

You can also test the server script directly for basic authentication, but **this requires temporarily setting the GH_TOKEN environment variable in your shell for this specific test**:
```bash
# For direct script testing ONLY (normal operation uses MCP client config)
export GH_TOKEN="ghp_YOUR_TEMPORARY_TEST_TOKEN"
node server.cjs
unset GH_TOKEN # Important: unset after testing
```
If successful, you should see "GitHub API authentication successful" and "GitHub Repos Manager MCP Server running on stdio".

- "For issue #50: add assignee `reviewer1`, lock it with reason 'resolved', and add a final comment 'Issue resolved in PR #51'."

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
1. **Token Problems**:
   - Double-check that the `GH_TOKEN` value in your MCP client's configuration is correct and doesn't have typos
   - Ensure the token hasn't expired or been revoked
   - Verify token validity using curl:
     ```bash
     export TEMP_TOKEN="ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_TO_TEST"
     curl -H "Authorization: token $TEMP_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
     unset TEMP_TOKEN
     ```
     This should return your GitHub user information.

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify the `GH_TOKEN` is correctly placed within the `env` object in your MCP client's server configuration
   - Ensure the path to `server.cjs` is absolute and correct
   - Check that Node.js version is 18 or higher: `node --version`

3. **Permission Issues**:
   - Ensure your token has the required scopes:
     - `repo` or `public_repo` (for repository access)
     - `user` (for user information)
     - `read:org` (for organization access, if needed)

### Performance & Rate Limiting
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- If you hit limits, wait for the reset window or use a different token
- The server includes built-in rate limit error handling

### Common Setup Issues
- **Path Issues**: Verify the absolute path in your Claude Desktop config is correct
- **Node.js Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher
- **File Permissions**: Make sure `server.cjs` is executable: `chmod +x server.cjs`

### Image Upload Troubleshooting
- Ensure image files exist at the specified local path
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- Check file permissions and accessibility
- Verify the file isn't corrupted or too large (GitHub has size limits)

## üö¶ API Rate Limits & Performance

- **Standard Rate Limits**: GitHub API allows 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- **Built-in Handling**: The server includes comprehensive error handling for rate limit responses
- **Performance Optimization**: Direct HTTP requests ensure faster response times compared to CLI tools
- **Caching Recommendations**: Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Token Security**: Never commit your `GH_TOKEN` to version control or share it publicly
- **Minimum Permissions**: Use tokens with only the minimum required scopes for your use case
- **Environment Variables**: Always provide tokens via the `env` block in your MCP client configuration
- **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate your GitHub tokens for enhanced security
- **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely using your system's credential management

## üîÑ Development & Contribution

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
mkdir github-repos-manager-mcp
cd github-repos-manager-mcp
# Add the server files
npm install
chmod +x server.cjs

# For development testing with nodemon
npm run dev
```

### Testing with MCP Clients
The recommended approach is configuring your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to point to your development version with proper `GH_TOKEN` configuration. Changes to `server.cjs` require restarting the server connection.

### Direct Script Testing
```bash
# Temporarily set token for quick verification
export GH_TOKEN="ghp_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_TOKEN"
node server.cjs
unset GH_TOKEN  # Always clean up after testing
```
