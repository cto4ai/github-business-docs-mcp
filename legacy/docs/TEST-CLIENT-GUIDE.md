## ⚙️ Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation

```bash
# Ensure GitHub MCP is properly installed
npm list | grep github-repos-manager-mcp

# Verify MCP client configuration includes the GitHub MCP server
# Check client-specific configuration files

# Confirm you're using a supported test environment:
# - Any compatible MCP client
# - Any supported LLM model
# - Access to kurdin/github-repos-manager-mcp-tests repository
```

### 2. Test Repository Verification

**Standard Test Repository (Default):**
```
Repository: kurdin/github-repos-manager-mcp-tests
Owner: kurdin
Type: Private
Status: ✅ Ready for testing (pre-configured with test data)
```

**Repository Features Available for Testing:**
- Multiple issues in various states (open/closed)
- Several pull requests for PR testing
- Multiple branches for branch operations
- Existing labels and milestones
- Sample files and directories
- Comprehensive test history and artifacts

**Alternative Repository Setup (Only if needed):**
If you need to test with a different repository, ensure it has:
- Read/write access for your GitHub token
- At least 2-3 issues with different states
- 1-2 branches beyond main
- Some existing labels and milestones
- Permission to create branches and files

### 3. Authentication Verification

```bash
# Verify GitHub token has required permissions:
# - repo (full control of private repositories)
# - read:user (read user profile data)  
# - read:org (read organization data)
```

### 4. Default Repository Setting

**Standard Testing Procedure (Always start with this):**
```
local__github-repos-manager__set_default_repo
├── owner: kurdin
└── repo: github-repos-manager-mcp-tests
```

**Expected Response:**
```
📦 Default repository set to: kurdin/github-repos-manager-mcp-tests
```

**Alternative Repository (Only if testing specific scenarios):**
```
local__github-repos-manager__set_default_repo
├── owner: your-username
└── repo: your-test-repository
```

**⚠️ Important Note:** Unless specifically testing with a different repository, ALL testing procedures assume you're using `kurdin/github-repos-manager-mcp-tests` as the default repository.

## 🎯 Best Practices for Testing

### ✅ Do's

1. **Always Use a Dedicated Test Repository**
   - Prevents pollution of production repositories
   - Allows for clean, repeatable testing
   - Provides isolated environment for experiments

2. **Test in Logical Sequence**
   - Start with basic operations (repository info)
   - Build up to complex operations (pull requests)
   - Test dependencies before dependent operations

3. **Document Everything**
   - Record all created artifacts
   - Note performance metrics
   - Screenshot unusual results

4. **Validate Against GitHub Web Interface**
   - Compare data accuracy
   - Verify URLs work correctly
   - Check that operations appear in GitHub UI

5. **Test Error Scenarios**
   - Try invalid parameters
   - Test with insufficient permissions
   - Verify graceful error handling

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Don't Test on Production Repositories**
   - Risk of creating unwanted issues/PRs
   - May trigger notifications to team members
   - Could interfere with actual work

2. **Don't Skip Authentication Verification**
   - Always confirm token permissions
   - Test with both valid and invalid credentials
   - Verify access to test repositories

3. **Don't Ignore Performance Issues**
   - Note any operations taking >5 seconds
   - Investigate timeout or failure patterns
   - Report significant performance regressions

4. **Don't Test Without Version Information**
   - Always record package version being tested
   - Note any recent updates or changes
   - Track improvements across versions

---

## 🔄 Regular Testing Schedule

### 📅 Recommended Testing Frequency

| Trigger | Testing Scope | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **New NPM Release** | Comprehensive | Validate updates and improvements |
| **Weekly** | Core Functions | Monitor production stability |
| **Before Production Deploy** | Full Suite | Ensure deployment readiness |
| **After GitHub API Changes** | Affected Areas | Verify continued compatibility |
| **User-Reported Issues** | Specific Tools | Investigate and validate fixes |

### 🎯 Automated Testing Considerations

Consider creating automated tests for:
- Basic connectivity and authentication
- Core CRUD operations on issues
- Repository information retrieval
- Search functionality
- Performance regression monitoring
