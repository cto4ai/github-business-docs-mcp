   - Return to Claude Desktop
   - Claude lists repository contents

**Troubleshooting:**

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Install

**Error:** "Failed to install extension"

**Solutions:**
1. Check Claude Desktop version (needs ‚â• 0.10.0)
2. Verify package isn't corrupted: `unzip -t github-docs-mcp-2.0.0.mcpb`
3. Try Method 2 (manual installation)

### OAuth Browser Doesn't Open

**Error:** Browser doesn't open for authorization

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-github-docs-mcp.log`
2. Verify port 3000 isn't in use: `lsof -i :3000`
3. Manually open: Look for URL in logs, paste in browser

### "Repository not found" Error

**Error:** Claude can't access repository

**Solutions:**
1. Verify default owner/repo are set correctly
2. Check your GitHub account has access to the repository
3. Try specifying explicitly: "List contents of owner/repo-name"

### Commits Show Wrong Username

**Problem:** Commits show bot name instead of your username

**This means OAuth isn't working correctly.**

**Solutions:**
1. Re-authorize: Ask Claude to do something, complete OAuth flow again
2. Check GitHub OAuth App permissions include `user:email`
3. Verify OAuth App is installed on your repository

### Token Expired

**Error:** "OAuth token expired"

**This is normal!** Tokens expire after 8 hours for security.

**Solution:**
1. Use the extension again
2. Browser opens for re-authorization
3. Click "Authorize"
4. Continue working
