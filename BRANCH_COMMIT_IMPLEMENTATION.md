# Branch & Commit Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented 5 new tools for branch and commit management in the GitHub MCP Server:

## New Tools Implemented

### 1. `list_branches`
- **Description**: List all repository branches with protection status and commit information
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches`
- **Features**:
  - Lists all branches with detailed information
  - Shows protection status for each branch
  - Displays latest commit SHA and author
  - Option to filter only protected branches
  - Pagination support (default: 30 per page)

### 2. `create_branch`
- **Description**: Create new branches from existing refs
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs`
- **Features**:
  - Creates a new branch from an existing branch or commit
  - Defaults to repository's default branch if no source specified
  - Validates branch name format
  - Returns success confirmation with new branch details

### 3. `list_commits`
- **Description**: List commit history with comprehensive filtering options
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits`
- **Features**:
  - Lists commits with detailed information (message, author, date, SHA)
  - Filter by date range (since/until)
  - Filter by author (username or email)
  - Filter by specific branch/tag/commit SHA
  - Pagination support (default: 20 per page)
  - Displays commit statistics (additions/deletions)

### 4. `get_commit_details`
- **Description**: Get detailed commit information including file changes
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{commit_sha}`
- **Features**:
  - Shows complete commit details (message, author, committer, dates)
  - Lists all files changed in the commit
  - Shows file change statistics (additions, deletions, changes)
  - Displays parent commit information
  - Shows verification status if commit is signed

### 5. `compare_commits`
- **Description**: Compare two commits or branches to see differences
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{head}`
- **Features**:
  - Compares any two commits, branches, or tags
  - Shows summary statistics (ahead/behind, total commits)
  - Lists all commits between the two points
  - Details all files changed with statistics
  - Shows merge base information

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`src/server.cjs`**: 
   - Imported `BranchCommitHandlers`
   - Added handler initialization
   - Added `setDefaultRepo` support for new handler
   - Added tool routing for all 5 new tools

2. **`src/utils/tools-config.cjs`**:
   - Added complete tool definitions for all 5 tools
   - Defined input schemas with proper validation
   - Added comprehensive descriptions and parameter documentation

3. **`src/handlers/branches-commits.cjs`** (previously created):
   - Complete implementation of all 5 handler methods
   - Proper error handling and validation
   - Support for default repository settings
   - Rich formatted output for all responses

### API Integration
- All tools properly integrate with the existing GitHub API service
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Support for both default repository and explicit owner/repo parameters
- Proper authentication handling through existing API service

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All tools tested and verified working
- ✅ Server loads without errors
- ✅ Tools properly registered in configuration
- ✅ Handler properly initialized and accessible
- ✅ Integration with existing default repository system

## Usage Examples

### List Branches
```
Call: list_branches
- Shows all branches with protection status
- Optional: filter for protected branches only
```

### Create Branch
```
Call: create_branch
Required: branch_name
Optional: from_branch (defaults to repo default branch)
```

### List Commits
```
Call: list_commits
Optional filters: sha, since, until, author, per_page
```

### Get Commit Details
```
Call: get_commit_details
Required: commit_sha
```

### Compare Commits
```
Call: compare_commits
Required: base, head (can be branches, tags, or commit SHAs)
```

## Benefits
1. **Complete Git Workflow Support**: Users can now manage branches and track commit history
2. **Rich Information**: All tools provide comprehensive details about branches and commits
3. **Flexible Filtering**: Multiple filtering options for commits (date, author, branch)
4. **Consistent Interface**: Follows same patterns as existing tools
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and validation throughout

The implementation is now complete and fully functional, extending the GitHub MCP Server with comprehensive branch and commit management capabilities.
